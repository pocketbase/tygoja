/**
 * Package time provides functionality for measuring and displaying time.
 * 
 * The calendrical calculations always assume a Gregorian calendar, with
 * no leap seconds.
 * 
 * # Monotonic Clocks
 * 
 * Operating systems provide both a “wall clock,” which is subject to
 * changes for clock synchronization, and a “monotonic clock,” which is
 * not. The general rule is that the wall clock is for telling time and
 * the monotonic clock is for measuring time. Rather than split the API,
 * in this package the Time returned by [time.Now] contains both a wall
 * clock reading and a monotonic clock reading; later time-telling
 * operations use the wall clock reading, but later time-measuring
 * operations, specifically comparisons and subtractions, use the
 * monotonic clock reading.
 * 
 * For example, this code always computes a positive elapsed time of
 * approximately 20 milliseconds, even if the wall clock is changed during
 * the operation being timed:
 * 
 * ```
 * 	start := time.Now()
 * 	... operation that takes 20 milliseconds ...
 * 	t := time.Now()
 * 	elapsed := t.Sub(start)
 * ```
 * 
 * Other idioms, such as [time.Since](start), [time.Until](deadline), and
 * time.Now().Before(deadline), are similarly robust against wall clock
 * resets.
 * 
 * The rest of this section gives the precise details of how operations
 * use monotonic clocks, but understanding those details is not required
 * to use this package.
 * 
 * The Time returned by time.Now contains a monotonic clock reading.
 * If Time t has a monotonic clock reading, t.Add adds the same duration to
 * both the wall clock and monotonic clock readings to compute the result.
 * Because t.AddDate(y, m, d), t.Round(d), and t.Truncate(d) are wall time
 * computations, they always strip any monotonic clock reading from their results.
 * Because t.In, t.Local, and t.UTC are used for their effect on the interpretation
 * of the wall time, they also strip any monotonic clock reading from their results.
 * The canonical way to strip a monotonic clock reading is to use t = t.Round(0).
 * 
 * If Times t and u both contain monotonic clock readings, the operations
 * t.After(u), t.Before(u), t.Equal(u), t.Compare(u), and t.Sub(u) are carried out
 * using the monotonic clock readings alone, ignoring the wall clock
 * readings. If either t or u contains no monotonic clock reading, these
 * operations fall back to using the wall clock readings.
 * 
 * On some systems the monotonic clock will stop if the computer goes to sleep.
 * On such a system, t.Sub(u) may not accurately reflect the actual
 * time that passed between t and u. The same applies to other functions and
 * methods that subtract times, such as [Since], [Until], [Before], [After],
 * [Add], [Sub], [Equal] and [Compare]. In some cases, you may need to strip
 * the monotonic clock to get accurate results.
 * 
 * Because the monotonic clock reading has no meaning outside
 * the current process, the serialized forms generated by t.GobEncode,
 * t.MarshalBinary, t.MarshalJSON, and t.MarshalText omit the monotonic
 * clock reading, and t.Format provides no format for it. Similarly, the
 * constructors [time.Date], [time.Parse], [time.ParseInLocation], and [time.Unix],
 * as well as the unmarshalers t.GobDecode, t.UnmarshalBinary.
 * t.UnmarshalJSON, and t.UnmarshalText always create times with
 * no monotonic clock reading.
 * 
 * The monotonic clock reading exists only in [Time] values. It is not
 * a part of [Duration] values or the Unix times returned by t.Unix and
 * friends.
 * 
 * Note that the Go == operator compares not just the time instant but
 * also the [Location] and the monotonic clock reading. See the
 * documentation for the Time type for a discussion of equality
 * testing for Time values.
 * 
 * For debugging, the result of t.String does include the monotonic
 * clock reading if present. If t != u because of different monotonic clock readings,
 * that difference will be visible when printing t.String() and u.String().
 * 
 * # Timer Resolution
 * 
 * [Timer] resolution varies depending on the Go runtime, the operating system
 * and the underlying hardware.
 * On Unix, the resolution is ~1ms.
 * On Windows version 1803 and newer, the resolution is ~0.5ms.
 * On older Windows versions, the default resolution is ~16ms, but
 * a higher resolution may be requested using [golang.org/x/sys/windows.TimeBeginPeriod].

   * A Time represents an instant in time with nanosecond precision.
   * 
   * Programs using times should typically store and pass them as values,
   * not pointers. That is, time variables and struct fields should be of
   * type [time.Time], not *time.Time.
   * 
   * A Time value can be used by multiple goroutines simultaneously except
   * that the methods [Time.GobDecode], [Time.UnmarshalBinary], [Time.UnmarshalJSON] and
   * [Time.UnmarshalText] are not concurrency-safe.
   * 
   * Time instants can be compared using the [Time.Before], [Time.After], and [Time.Equal] methods.
   * The [Time.Sub] method subtracts two instants, producing a [Duration].
   * The [Time.Add] method adds a Time and a Duration, producing a Time.
   * 
   * The zero value of type Time is January 1, year 1, 00:00:00.000000000 UTC.
   * As this time is unlikely to come up in practice, the [Time.IsZero] method gives
   * a simple way of detecting a time that has not been initialized explicitly.
   * 
   * Each time has an associated [Location]. The methods [Time.Local], [Time.UTC], and Time.In return a
   * Time with a specific Location. Changing the Location of a Time value with
   * these methods does not change the actual instant it represents, only the time
   * zone in which to interpret it.
   * 
   * Representations of a Time value saved by the [Time.GobEncode], [Time.MarshalBinary],
   * [Time.MarshalJSON], and [Time.MarshalText] methods store the [Time.Location]'s offset, but not
   * the location name. They therefore lose information about Daylight Saving Time.
   * 
   * In addition to the required “wall clock” reading, a Time may contain an optional
   * reading of the current process's monotonic clock, to provide additional precision
   * for comparison or subtraction.
   * See the “Monotonic Clocks” section in the package documentation for details.
   * 
   * Note that the Go == operator compares not just the time instant but also the
   * Location and the monotonic clock reading. Therefore, Time values should not
   * be used as map or database keys without first guaranteeing that the
   * identical Location has been set for all values, which can be achieved
   * through use of the UTC or Local method, and that the monotonic clock reading
   * has been stripped by setting t = t.Round(0). In general, prefer t.Equal(u)
   * to t == u, since t.Equal uses the most accurate comparison available and
   * correctly handles the case when only one of its arguments has a monotonic
   * clock reading.
